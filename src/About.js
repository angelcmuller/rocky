                <p id='description'> Team 09 "Project Rocky Road" is formed by Computer Science and Engineering
                students from the University of Nevada Reno. At some point in their student life, they
                shared moments in the classroom and ended up creating this team to learn and try to solve
                a real life problem. </p>
                <br/>

                <h1 id='meetTeam'> Description </h1>

                <p id='description'> The goal of project Rocky Road is to present information concerning road
                obstructions in hopes of preventing potential road based inconveniences, injuries, and
                fatalities. Rocky Road will achieve this goal using the distribution of information, through
                a web application, to bring better awareness of road conditions and hazards. Another way the
                project will accomplish its objectives is by informing infrastructure management organizations
                of road conditions to allow them to optimize their approaches to addressing these conditions.
                By making this project open source users will be allowed to contribute to the map, creating a
                global network of road conditions and thus making the world a safer place. In support of this
                goal, the Sierra Nevada Corporation contributed data and personnel resources which act as the
                foundation for this system.</p>
